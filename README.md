I am a longtime fan of Taylor Swift, and I admire her songwriting skills and ability to tell vivid stories with so few words. With a current discography of nine unique albums (not including rereleases or bonus editions) chronicling her life from ages 15 to 30, Swift has written an extensive amount of song lyrics that are ripe for analysis.
For my first foray into Python programming, I endeavored to take on this vast dataset of song lyrics. My first goal was to visually model the lyrics, sorted by album, in word clouds (also called tag clouds), which are an eye-catching and effective way to visualize language data. To view the word clouds I created, see the folder titled wordclouds.
My second goal is to perform statistical analysis and sentiment analysis on the dataset to determine prevalent lyrics, lyrical and thematic consistencies or changes throughout her career, and implications of Swift as a songwriter and wordsmith.
