I am a longtime fan of Taylor Swift, and I admire her songwriting skills and ability to tell vivid stories with so few words. With a current discography of nine unique albums (not including rereleases or special editions) chronicling her life from ages 15 to 30, Swift has written an extensive amount of song lyrics that are ripe for analysis.

For my first foray into Python programming, I endeavored to take on this vast dataset of song lyrics. I defined my dataset to include Swiftâ€™s main studio albums, as follows: Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, reputation, Lover, folklore, evermore.

Goals:
1. Visually model the lyrics, sorted by album, in word clouds (also called tag clouds), which are an eye-catching and effective way to visualize language data
2. Perform analysis on the dataset to determine lyrical and thematic consistencies and changes throughout Swift's career, and implications of her as a songwriter and wordsmith
3. Perform rule-based sentiment analysis on the dataset to determine the sentiment or mood of each song and album

Scripts:
1. Get data: get_songs.ipynb
2. Create word clouds: make_wordclouds.ipynb
3. Perform analysis: sentiment_analysis.ipynb
